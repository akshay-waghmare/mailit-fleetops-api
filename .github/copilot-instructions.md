# Copilot Instructions â€” FleetOps Management System Implementation
Purpose
-------
Implement comprehensive Pickup and Order Management systems with database integration, providing consistent and professional user experience for managing logistics operations across the FleetOps platform.

Spec-Driven Development Extension
---------------------------------
We are adopting GitHub Spec Kit (Specify CLI). See `.github/SPEC-KIT-ADOPTION-PLAN.md` for rollout phases. For any new substantial feature:
- Create spec & plan under `specs/<NNN-feature>/` using `/specify`, `/clarify` (if needed), `/plan`, `/tasks`.
- Keep tasks failing-first for contract/integration tests before implementation.
- Contracts (`contracts/`) and data model (`data-model.md`) are authoritative; update them before changing code.
- Refer to path-specific instructions in `.github/instructions/specs.instructions.md` for rules & review checklist.

Quick Demo / Current Status
---------------------------
**Pickup Management** âœ… - Fully implemented:
- Pickup Creation: http://localhost:4200/pickups (pickup scheduling component)
- Pickup Management: http://localhost:4200/pickup-list (management dashboard)
- Pickup Analytics: http://localhost:4200/pickup-analytics (analytics dashboard)
- Backend Integration: Complete with PostgreSQL database

**Order Management** ðŸŽ¯ - Implementation in progress:
- Order Creation: http://localhost:4200/orders (existing order scheduling component)
- Order Management List: http://localhost:4200/order-list (new management dashboard)
- Order Analytics: http://localhost:4200/order-analytics (new analytics dashboard)
- Backend Integration: Planned with comprehensive database schema

Quick run steps (from repo root):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve console-app --port 4200

# In separate terminal for backend
cd backend
docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev ./gradlew bootRun
```

Integration Plans Overview
--------------------------

7) Development Workflow
-----------------------

Execution guidance and constraints
---------------------------------
- Follow existing conventions in the repo for file locations, naming, and module boundaries. Inspect `frontend/apps/console-app` and `frontend/apps/ui-kit` to mirror patterns.
- Use Angular Material components and Tailwind utilities already present in the project. Respect `tailwind.config.js` colors and theming.
- Do not create or publish external packages. Do not make network requests to external services while implementing tests; mock HTTP responses instead.
- Avoid exposing secrets or changing CI/CD configurations in this change. Keep changes scoped to the pickup management feature.

API and data contract
---------------------
Use the endpoints and TypeScript interfaces listed in `PICKUP-MANAGEMENT-DASHBOARD-PLAN.md` as the source of truth for service shapes and query parameters. If an endpoint is missing, create a TODO and implement the frontend assuming the interface; coordinate backend changes via a separate issue/PR.

Development checklist for each PR
-------------------------------
- Branch name follows `feature/pickup-management`.
- Commit messages are small, focused, and reference the issue/plan when applicable.
- Add/modify routes and navigation entries with clear titles and icons.
- Include unit tests for new components and services. Keep tests fast and deterministic.
- Run `npm run build` (or `ng build console-app`) and `npm test` locally; fix errors before PR.

How to validate locally (short)
------------------------------
1. From repo root: install deps (if needed) and start console app dev server:

  cd frontend
  npm install
  ng serve console-app --port 4200

**Execution Guidance and Constraints:**
- Follow existing conventions in the repo for file locations, naming, and module boundaries
- Use Angular Material components and Tailwind utilities already present in the project
- Respect `tailwind.config.js` colors and theming
- Do not create or publish external packages
- Mock HTTP responses in tests instead of making network requests to external services
- Keep changes scoped to pickup/order management features

**API and Data Contract:**
- Use endpoints and TypeScript interfaces in implementation plans as source of truth
- If an endpoint is missing, create a TODO and implement frontend assuming the interface
- Coordinate backend changes via separate issue/PR

**Development Checklist for Each PR:**
- Branch name follows `feature/pickup-management` or `feature/order-management`
- Commit messages are small, focused, and reference the issue/plan when applicable
- Add/modify routes and navigation entries with clear titles and icons
- Include unit tests for new components and services
- Run `npm run build` and `npm test` locally; fix errors before PR

**How to Validate Locally:**

1. Start frontend dev server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve console-app --port 4200
```

2. Start backend (if testing integration):
```bash
cd backend
docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev ./gradlew bootRun
```

3. Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test --workspace=console-app
```

If build or tests fail, iterate locally and fix lint/type issues.

**Documentation References:**
All documentation has been organized in the `/docs` folder:
- **Setup & Installation**: `docs/setup/` - Project setup and configuration
- **Infrastructure**: `docs/infrastructure/` - Docker and deployment guides
- **Implementation Plans**: `docs/implementation/` - Active development roadmaps
- **Completed Features**: `docs/completed/` - Documentation for finished implementations

Key references:
- Pickup Management: `docs/completed/PICKUP-INTEGRATION-PHASE1-COMPLETE.md` (completed implementation)
- Order Management: `docs/implementation/ORDER-MANAGEMENT-DATABASE-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` (implementation plan)
- Order UI: `docs/completed/MAILIT-STYLE-ORDERS-COMPLETE.md` (frontend design completed)

**Contact / Notes:**
If a missing backend API or schema prevents implementing a feature, add a TODO in the code and open an issue describing the required endpoint and minimal contract.

This file is intentionally concise â€” use the referenced implementation plans as the authoritative specification for feature details. Implement incrementally: foundation (list + service) â†’ analytics â†’ details/actions â†’ exports/real-time.
